		<p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
		<p> and Dean and Sam where crying yet again</p>
		<p>Because it was Thursday.</p>
		<p> but lets be honest, they cry all the time, Don't get me started on Cas</p>
		<p>Which is why the character of Crowley was so desperately needed. Someone had to come in and call them all out.<br>
			Then again, he's also had his moments, though not nearly as bad as the others.</p>
